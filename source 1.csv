A relative contraindication for induction of labour includes which one of the followings?","[""Prolonged pregnancy"", ""Severe pre-eclampsia"", ""Intrauterine growth restriction"", ""Previous myomectomy entering the uterine cavity at the fundus"", ""Prolonged rupture of membranes without labor""]",4,"A history of myomectomy that involved entry into the uterine cavity, particularly in the fundal region, carries a significant risk of uterine rupture during labor, especially when uterotonic agents are used for induction. This makes it a relative contraindication to labor induction. In most cases, elective cesarean section is recommended.
