"A woman requesting induction of labour, as she is at 41 weeks. A relative contraindication for induction of labour includes which one of the followings?","Prolonged pregnancy|Severe pre-eclampsia|Intrauterine growth restriction|Previous myomectomy entering the uterine cavity at the fundus|Prolonged rupture of membranes without labor",4,"A history of myomectomy that involved entry into the uterine cavity, particularly in the fundal region, carries a significant risk of uterine rupture during labor, especially when uterotonic agents are used for induction. This makes it a relative contraindication to labor induction. In most cases, elective cesarean section is recommended.","Prolonged pregnancy - X Indication, not a contraindication. Induction is recommended at or after 41 weeks to prevent stillbirth and other complications.|Severe pre-eclampsia - X Indication for delivery. Induction is often initiated to reduce maternal and fetal risk.|Intrauterine growth restriction â€“ X Indication for delivery, especially if fetal testing is non-reassuring or growth is severely restricted.|Prolonged rupture of membranes without labor - X Indication to reduce the risk of intrauterine infection (e.g., chorioamnionitis), especially if the patient is Group B Strep positive.","A previous myomectomy involving the uterine cavity is a relative contraindication to labor induction, particularly with prostaglandins or oxytocin, due to the risk of uterine rupture. Most other options listed are clear indications for induction of labor"
