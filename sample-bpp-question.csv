"A 25-years-old primigravida at 37 weeks presented with decrease fetal movement. Non stress test was done 2 times in the labour and delivery ward, Non reactive. The doctor arranged for biophysical profiles test. Which of the following is not part of this test?","[""Fetal tone"",""Fetal breathing"",""Fetal body movements"",""Amniotic fluid volume""]",4,"The biophysical profile (BPP) is a test used to assess fetal well-being, especially when concerns arise from a non-reactive NST or decreased fetal movements. It combines ultrasound evaluation with a non-stress test to evaluate five parameters, each scored as 0 or 2. NST (reactive = 2 points). Fetal tone. Fetal breathing movements. Fetal body movements. Amniotic fluid volume. A score of 8-10 is considered reassuring, ≤4 suggests fetal hypoxia or acidosis and may warrant immediate delivery depending on gestational age.","{""A"": ""Included in BPP. Assesses flexion and extension of fetal limbs/spine."",""B"": ""Included in BPP. Evaluates for at least one episode of breathing motion lasting ≥30 seconds."",""C"": ""Included in BPP. Looks for gross movements such as trunk or limb motion."",""D"": ""Included in BPP. Adequate volume (usually a single pocket ≥2 cm) suggests normal placental function.""}","The biophysical profile (BPP) is a comprehensive test used to evaluate fetal well-being and includes: NST, fetal tone, fetal breathing movements, fetal body movements, and amniotic fluid volume. The contraction stress test is a separate test that evaluates the fetal heart rate response to uterine contractions and is not part of the BPP."
