A relative contraindication for induction of labour includes which one of the followings?","[""Prolonged pregnancy"",""Severe pre-eclampsia"",""Intrauterine growth restriction"",""Previous myomectomy entering the uterine cavity at the fundus"",""Prolonged rupture of membranes without labor""]",4,"A history of myomectomy that involved entry into the uterine cavity, particularly in the fundal region, carries a significant risk of uterine rupture during labor, especially when uterotonic agents are used for induction. This makes it a relative contraindication to labor induction. In most cases, elective cesarean section is recommended.","{""A"": ""Prolonged pregnancy - X Indication, not a contraindication. Induction is recommended at or after 41 weeks to prevent stillbirth and other complications."",""B"": ""Severe pre-eclampsia - X Indication for delivery. Induction is often initiated to reduce maternal and fetal risk."",""C"": ""Intrauterine growth restriction - X Indication for delivery, especially if fetal testing is non-reassuring or growth is severely restricted."",""E"": ""Prolonged rupture of membranes without labor - X Indication to reduce the risk of intrauterine infection (e.g., chorioamnionitis), especially if the patient is Group B Strep positive.""}","A previous myomectomy involving the uterine cavity is a relative contraindication to labor induction, particularly with prostaglandins or oxytocin, due to the risk of uterine rupture. Most other options listed are clear indications for induction of labor"
